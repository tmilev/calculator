<h2> Project mission</h2>
The mission of the calculator project is, to the extent possible,
<blockquote>
to develop a universally accessible, free and open source computer algebra system covering
all computational aspects of mathematical research and math education, 
using an intuitive and user friendly interface that gives 
full programmatic control over the system to its users.
</blockquote>
<h2>History of the project</h2>

My name is Todor Milev and I started programming the calculator project in C++ in December 2008. 

The original purpose of the calculator was to help with my 
combinatorial calculations in Representation Theory (a branch of mathematics). 
<br>
<br>
Since 2008, I have kept on expanding the mathematical capabilities of the system,
from basic ones such as differentiation, integration, 3-d and 2-d plotting 
to advanced ones such as Gr&#246;bner bases, 
vector partition functions and quasipolynomials,
semisimple Lie algebras of classical and exceptional type, 
Weyl groups and their representations, 
Weyl algebras, 
and others. I am relying exclusively on my computer algebra system for my research 
and have published a number of scientific articles with it.

<br>
<br>
In addition to my scientific work, I have tried to make the calculator
accessible to the public. The project got its first on line interface in 2010, using the Apache web server.
In 2012/2013, Apache was phased out in favor of a 
web server that I built from scratch using Linux system calls. 

<br>
<br>
In 2012, after a few months of experimenting with various approaches for symbolic computation, 
I finally implemented an arbitrary rule substitution engine. 
This made the calculator fully programmable and thus the project grew from 
an advanced scientific calculator to a true computer algebra system. 
<br>
<br>
In December 2015 I started developing an on line homework system as an extension of the calculator engine. 
The system was first tested by my students in February 2016, and has been in continuous development ever since. 


<h2>About the substitution engine</h2>
The substitution engine is inspired by LISP and MATHEMATICA,
and features a clean, streamlined architecture (perhaps better streamlined even than both of these languages).

<br>
<br>

Similarly to LISP, the calculator has internally only one type of data structure, 
called an expression. 
The data structure is an arbitrary expression tree with leaves that are
32 or 64-bit integers (depending on the C++ compiler). 
The leaf nodes are called atoms. 

<br>
<br>
The main expression used as an input of 
the calculator is called (the main) program (expression). 

A completed run of the calculator is a reduction of the program 
expression according to a set of (pre-defined and user-defined) 
rules to a state in which there are no more valid transformations. 
The user-defined rules are themselves given as expressions, 
and, being part of the main program expression, can be dynamically altered and generated. 
Built-in rules can be dynamically turned on and off. 
<br>
<br>


Of course, should the substitution rules lead to an infinite substitution cycle 
or to ever-expanding program expression, 
a run of the calculator may never terminate - in theory. 
In practice, we simply limit the computation time.
This appears to be the only practical solution, as the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">Halting Problem</a>
implies that the running time of an arbitrary 
computation cannot be predicted with an algorithm. 

<br>
<br>
The calculator supports functional programming, at the deepest level: for example
it can use non-atomic expressions and constants as functions.
<h2> Project contributors</h2>
This section has been last updated in May 2017.
<br>
<br>
As of May 2017, more than 95% of the C++ and javascript code of the calculator was written by myself; 
the rest was written by Thomas Folz-Donahue as a part of a research project under my guidance
(dealing with the Representation Theory of Finite Groups, focusing on Weyl groups). 

<br>
<br>
Besides actual engine coding, many people have helped build this project. 
Ian Chua has composed a number of problems; 
Deyan Yotsov has done a lot of work on the server setup 
and is currently providing the host machine and internet connection; 
Thomas Bliem set up the source code repository. 
Many people have contributed through advice and other means; 
I will prepare a more detailed list in the foreseeable future.

<br>
<br>



In addition, the calculator uses code from the following projects:

<ol>
<li> The standard Linux system headers</li>
<li> MathQuill</li>
<li> MathJax </li>
<li> OpenSSL</li>
<li> jquery</li>
<li> The Ace editor (not related to ACE learning)</li>
<li> MySQL</li>
<li> Google capcha</li>
<li> The standard C++ library.</li>
</ol>

Furthermore, the calculator utilizes a number of projects without directly using their code, 
but rather through their executables or through system calls (or both). These include:
<ol>
<li> Linux</li>
<li> Modern web browsers</li>
<li> The Curl project</li>
<li> LaTeX.</li>
</ol>


<h2>About the software</h2>
The source code of the calculator can be found here. 
<br>
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/vectorpartition/code/HEAD/tree/">Calculator source code</a>
<br>
The code is to be compiled on a Linux machine.

<br>
<br>
Most of the functionality of the system should work out of the box
(if not, it's a bug).
However, for obvious reasons, parts of the calculator will not work immediately 
- for example, the officially signed security certificates of calculator-algebra.org 
are kept secret. If you need help setting up the calculator on your machine, write me an email
(todor.milev at google's email).

<h3>Software license</h3>
You are free to use the calculator, install it on your machine, and 
modify it's source code, under the LGPL 3.0 license 
(a free software license published by the Free Software Foundation). 
<br>
<br>
The calculator is fully functional without any homework problem files, 
and provides facilities for creating such files 
(I create my own homework files through the calculator interface). 
Should you install the calculator on your own machine and 
create your own homework problems, 
you own the copyright to the resulting files; those are not subject  
to the LGPL 3.0 license. 
<br>
<br>
The homework problems located at www.calculator-algebra.org are private and are not subject to the 
LGPL 3.0 license.

<h2> Plans for the future</h2>
I am interested in both academic and business opportunities for developing 
educational software and general mathematical software. 
In particular, I am interested in providing facilities for teachers and university professors for 
constructing their own on line courses.
<br>
<br>
I intend to continue developing this project my entire life.
If you are interested in this project,
feel free to write me an email (todor.milev at google's email).
