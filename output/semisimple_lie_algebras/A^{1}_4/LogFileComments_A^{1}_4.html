<hr>Attention: using non-tested optimization, please double-check by hand. I have just rejected type 2A^{10}_1 as non-realizable for the following reasons. The type's summand A^{10}_1 has complement summand A^{10}_1.  I computed the latter complement summand has centralizer 0. Then I computed the absolute Dynkin indices of the centralizer's sl(2)-subalgebras, namely:<br> . If the type was realizable, those would have to contain  the absolute Dynkin indices of sl(2) subalgebras of the original summand. However, that is not the case.  I can therefore conclude that the Dynkin type 2A^{10}_1 is not realizable.  The absolute Dynkin indices of the sl(2) subalgebras of the original summand I computed to be:<br> 10. <hr>Attention: using non-tested optimization, please double-check by hand. I have just rejected type 2A^{5}_1 as non-realizable for the following reasons. The type's summand A^{5}_1 has complement summand A^{5}_1.  I computed the latter complement summand has centralizer 0. Then I computed the absolute Dynkin indices of the centralizer's sl(2)-subalgebras, namely:<br> .

I can therefore conclude that the Dynkin type 2A^{5}_1 is not realizable.  The absolute Dynkin indices of the sl(2) subalgebras of the original summand I computed to be:<br> 5. <hr>Attention: using non-tested optimization, please double-check by hand. I have just rejected type 2A^{2}_1+A^{1}_1 as non-realizable for the following reasons. I computed that the type's summand 2A^{2}_1 has complement summand A^{1}_1.  Then I computed the latter complement summand has centralizer A^{1}_2. Then I computed the absolute Dynkin indices of the centralizer's sl(2)-subalgebras, namely:<br> 4, 1. If the type was realizable, those would have to contain  the absolute Dynkin indices of sl(2) subalgebras of the original summand. However, that is not the case. I can therefore conclude that the Dynkin type 2A^{2}_1+A^{1}_1 is not realizable.  The absolute Dynkin indices of the sl(2) subalgebras of the original summand I computed to be:<br> 2, 4. <hr>Attention: using non-tested optimization, please double-check by hand. I have just rejected type A^{1}_3+A^{10}_1 as non-realizable for the following reasons. I computed that the type's summand A^{10}_1 has complement summand A^{1}_3.  Then I computed the latter complement summand has centralizer 0. Then I computed the absolute Dynkin indices of the centralizer's sl(2)-subalgebras, namely:<br> . If the type was realizable, those would have to contain  the absolute Dynkin indices of sl(2) subalgebras of the original summand. However, that is not the case.
