1. Include headers.
2. Add ListReferences<yourtypehere> to class ObjectContainer.
3. Add to class CommandList a static bool myFunctionName (CommandList&, const Expression&, Expression&)
4. Hook up the newly created function to a calling string. To do that modify CommandList::initPredefinedInnerFunctions  located in vpf4CalculatorFunctionList.cpp
5. Implement myFunctionName
6. Call output.AssignValue(myNewObject, theComands)
7. in file vpf6.cpp implement AddObjectReturnIndex<yourtypehere> by copy& paste and common sense replacement.
8. in file vpf6.cpp implement GetTypeFromOperation<yourtypehere> by copy, paste and common sense replacement.
9. in file vpf6.cpp implement GetValuENonConstUseWithCaution<yourtypehere> by copy, paste and common sense replacement.
