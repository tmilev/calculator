 *  RIPEMD160.c : RIPEMD-160 implementation

 * ===================================================================
 *
 * Country of origin: Canada
 *
 * This implementation (written in C) is based on an implementation the author
 * wrote in Python.
 *
 * This implementation was written with reference to the RIPEMD-160
 * specification, which is available at:
 * http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~cosicart/pdf/AB-9601/
 *
 * It is also documented in the _Handbook of Applied Cryptography_, as
 * Algorithm 9.55.  It's on page 30 of the following PDF file:
 * http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/about/chap9.pdf
 *
 * The RIPEMD-160 specification doesn't really tell us how to do padding, but
 * since RIPEMD-160 is inspired by MD4, you can use the padding algorithm from
 * RFC 1320.
 *
 * According to http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/hopwood/crypto/scan/md.html:
 *   "RIPEMD-160 is big-bit-endian, little-byte-endian, and left-justified."

/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Works when compiled for either 32-bit or 64-bit targets, optimized for 
 * 64 bit.
 *
 * Canonical implementation of Init/Update/Finalize for SHA-3 byte input. 
 *
 * SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA-512 are implemented. SHA-224 can easily be added.
 *
 * Based on code from http://keccak.noekeon.org/ .
 *
 * I place the code that I wrote into public domain, free to use. 
 *
 * I would appreciate if you give credits to this work if you used it to 
 * write or test * your code.
