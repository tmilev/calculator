The files are: 

polyhedra.h, polyhedra.cpp: The big guns. All the algorithms are here. No external libraries used except for std!

rootSA.cpp: some WINAPI interface with a bit of graphics to give more appeal.

rootSA.def: unfortunately needed to export functions from the dll. If you want to export more functions, modify rootSA.def.

License_LGPL-3.0.txt: the license!

All other files (except for the current one of course :) are automatically generated.
