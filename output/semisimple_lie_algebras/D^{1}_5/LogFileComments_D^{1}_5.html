<hr>I have rejected type 2A^{30}_1 as non-realizable for the following reasons. The type's summand A^{30}_1 has complement summand A^{30}_1. I computed the latter complement summand has centralizer 0. Then I computed the absolute Dynkin indices of the centralizer's sl(2)-subalgebras, namely:<br> . If the type was realizable, those would have to contain the absolute Dynkin indices of sl(2) subalgebras of the original summand. However, that is not the case. I can therefore conclude that the Dynkin type 2A^{30}_1 is not realizable. The absolute Dynkin indices of the sl(2) subalgebras of the original summand I computed to be:<br> 30. <hr>I have rejected type A^{20}_1+A^{10}_1 as non-realizable for the following reasons. The type's summand A^{10}_1 has complement summand A^{20}_1. I computed the latter complement summand has centralizer 0. Then I computed the absolute Dynkin indices of the centralizer's sl(2)-subalgebras, namely:<br> . If the type was realizable, those would have to contain the absolute Dynkin indices of sl(2) subalgebras of the original summand. However, that is not the case. I can therefore conclude that the Dynkin type A^{20}_1+A^{10}_1 is not realizable. The absolute Dynkin indices of the sl(2) subalgebras of the original summand I computed to be:<br> 10.
