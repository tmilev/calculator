The absolute Dynkin indices of the sl(2) subalgebras of the original summand I computed to be:<br> 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 9. <hr>I have rejected type A^{4}_1+A^{3}_1+A^{1}_1 as non-realizable for the following reasons. I computed that the type's summand A^{4}_1+A^{3}_1 has complement summand A^{1}_1. Then I computed the latter complement summand has centralizer D^{1}_6. Then I computed the absolute Dynkin indices of the centralizer's sl(2)-subalgebras, namely:<br> 110, 62, 60, 38, 35, 30, 29, 28, 20, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. If the type was realizable, those would have to contain the absolute Dynkin indices of sl(2) subalgebras of the original summand. However, that is not the case. I can therefore conclude that the Dynkin type A^{4}_1+A^{3}_1+A^{1}_1 is not realizable. The absolute Dynkin indices of the sl(2) subalgebras of the original summand I computed to be:<br> 3, 4, 7.
