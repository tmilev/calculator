I can therefore conclude that the Dynkin type A^{2}_2+3A^{1}_1 is not realizable. The absolute Dynkin indices of the sl(2) subalgebras of the original summand I computed to be:<br> 1, 2, 3. <hr>I have rejected type B^{1}_2+A^{8}_1+A^{2}_1 as non-realizable for the following reasons. I computed that the type's summand B^{1}_2+A^{8}_1 has complement summand A^{2}_1.  Then I computed the latter complement summand has centralizer C^{1}_3. Then I computed the absolute Dynkin indices of the centralizer's sl(2)-subalgebras, namely:<br> 35, 11, 10, 8, 3, 2, 1. If the type was realizable, those would have to contain the absolute Dynkin indices of sl(2) subalgebras of the original summand. However, that is not the case. I can therefore conclude that the Dynkin type B^{1}_2+A^{8}_1+A^{2}_1 is not realizable. The absolute Dynkin indices of the sl(2) subalgebras of the original summand I computed to be:<br> 8, 10, 18, 2, 1, 9. <hr>I have rejected type 2B^{1}_2+A^{20}_1 as non-realizable for the following reasons. I computed that the type's summand B^{1}_2+A^{20}_1 has complement summand B^{1}_2.  Then I computed the latter complement summand has centralizer C^{1}_3. Then I computed the absolute Dynkin indices of the centralizer's sl(2)-subalgebras, namely:<br> 35, 11, 10, 8, 3, 2, 1. If the type was realizable, those would have to contain the absolute Dynkin indices of sl(2) subalgebras of the original summand. However, that is not the case. I can therefore conclude that the Dynkin type 2B^{1}_2+A^{20}_1 is not realizable. The absolute Dynkin indices of the sl(2) subalgebras of the original summand I computed to be:<br> 20, 10, 30, 2, 22, 1, 21.
