# Featureflags should be self-explanatory.  Pthreads are (so far 2015-11) only
# used for calculator code, but this is likely to change.  Openmp was lightly
# used in some code in late 2015.
# Optimization flags have not actually been tested.  -Og is not used for
# debug builds because building performance matters more than running
# performance.  -O3 doesn't slow down non-debug builds too much, and it is
# expected that this will be built on systems that use it, thus -march=native.
# -flto was experimented with, as it is the way to achieve the vaunted
# benefits of seeing the program before running it, but was ultimately too
# slow
# Those -MMD -Mp things create files that notify make about what the
# header dependencies so things can be correctly rebuilt.  A 'make clean'
# is of course suggested when changing compilation options, not that something
# bad will happen, but something bad is not guaranteed not to happen.
# AllocationStatistics is Thomas' feature to notify the user with a glibc
# prepared stack trace every time an object is allocated that crosses a
# megabyte boundary, in order to find hot spots of massive memory allocation
# it needs -rdynamic due to implementation
