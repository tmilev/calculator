# Folder for all user output files

User-generated computations that were generated after time out are to be 
output here. The folder has restricted read rights, which means 
different users cannot see each other's outputs. Each output file has 
a unique with probability ~1 filename. 
The filename is shared only with the user that initiated the computation. 
Anyone with access to the filename can read its content.
