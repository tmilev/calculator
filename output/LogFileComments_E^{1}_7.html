<hr>Attention: using non-tested optimization, please double-check by hand. I have just rejected type A^{1}_5+A^{1}_2 as non-realizable for the following reasons. I computed that the type's summand A^{1}_2 has complement summand A^{1}_5.  Then I computed the latter complement summand has centralizer A^{1}_1. Then I computed the absolute Dynkin indices of the centralizer's sl(2)-subalgebras, namely:<br> 1. If the type was realizable, those would have to contain  the absolute Dynkin indices of sl(2) subalgebras of the original summand. However, that is not the case. The absolute Dynkin indices of the sl(2) subalgebras of the original summand I computed to be:<br> 4, 1. <hr>Attention: using non-tested optimization, please double-check by hand.
