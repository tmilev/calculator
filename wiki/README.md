# The calculator substitution engine

## Examples first please!

### Arithmetics
```
1+1
```
[1+1](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%221%2B1%22%7D)

Default computations are over the rational numbers.
```
1+2-3*4/5^{6}
```
[1+2-3*4/5^{6}](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%221%2B2-3*4%2F5%5E%7B6%7D%22%7D)

Large number arithmetic works without approximations.
```
101!/(101!+1)
```
[101!/(101!+1)](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%22101!%20%2F%20(101!%2B1)%22%7D)

Floating point conversions need to be invoked explicitly.
```
DoubleValue( 100! / (101!+1))
```
[DoubleValue( 100! / (101!+1))](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%22DoubleValue(%20100!%20%2F%20(101!%2B1))%22%7D)

... but as usual, careful with approximations.
```
DoubleValue( 1000! / (1001!+1))
```
[DoubleValue( 1000! / (1001!+1))](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%22DoubleValue(%201000!%20%2F%20(1001!%2B1))%22%7D)

### Get the LaTeX from any computation
Enter your input in loose syntax, get it beautifully formatted. Double-click the formatted formula to get the underlying LaTeX.
```
1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/x))))
```
[1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/x))))](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%221%2B1%2F(1%2B1%2F(1%2B1%2F(1%2B1%2F(1%2B1%2Fx))))%22%2C%22monitoring%22%3A%22true%22%7D)

LaTeX output is re-entrant: take the LaTeX from the previous computation and paste it back into the input box.
```
1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/x))));
1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{x}}}}}
```
[1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/x))));1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{x}}}}}](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%221%2B1%2F(1%2B1%2F(1%2B1%2F(1%2B1%2F(1%2B1%2Fx))))%3B%5Cn1%2B%5C%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B1%2B%5C%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B1%2B%5C%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B1%2B%5C%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B1%2B%5C%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bx%7D%7D%7D%7D%7D%22%2C%22monitoring%22%3A%22true%22%7D)

The syntax is loose - and although there haven't been major changes in the last few years, we do not assume syntax is set in stone, just as in regular mathematics.
For single-line formulas, we guarantee the calculator's interpretation of your input is:

- well-formed LaTeX that displays nicely;
- can be parsed back by the calculator;
- forms a valid normalized input equivalent to the entered one.

### Trigonometry, inverse trig, logarithms

Trig works with algebraic numbers if available; pi is built-in.
```
\sin (pi/3);
\cos (\pi/5);
```

[\sin (pi/3); \cos (\pi/5);](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%22%5C%5Csin%20(pi%2F3)%3B%5Cn%5C%5Ccos%20(%5C%5Cpi%2F5)%3B%22%2C%22monitoring%22%3A%22true%22%7D)

Degrees work as expected.
```
\tan 30^\circ
```
[\tan 30^\circ](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%22%5C%5Ctan%2030%5E%5C%5Ccirc%22%2C%22monitoring%22%3A%22true%22%2C%22inputFocus%22%3Atrue%7D)

Inverse trigonometry and logarithms evaluate as expected.
```
\ln 12;
\arctan 13;
```
[\ln 12;\arctan 13;](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%22%5C%5Cln%2012%3B%5Cn%5C%5Carctan%2013%3B%22%2C%22monitoring%22%3A%22true%22%7D)

Logarithms are clever.
```
log_{8} 128
```
[log_{8} 128](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%22log_%7B8%7D%20128%22%2C%22monitoring%22%3A%22true%22%7D)
### Computations with matrices
Enter a matrix. Double-click the output matrix to get the LaTeX used in the next example. 
```
MakeMatrix ((1, 2), (3, 4))
```
[MakeMatrix ((1, 2), (3, 4))](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%22MakeMatrix%20((1%2C%202)%2C%20(3%2C%204))%22%2C%22monitoring%22%3A%22true%22%7D)

All basic operations work. Latex matrix parsing works as expected.
```
A=\begin{pmatrix}1&2\\ 3&4\end{pmatrix}; 
A+A; 
A-A; 
2*A; 
A^5; 
A^t;
A^-1; 
A \otimes A; 
A \oplus A; 
\det A
```
[A=\begin{pmatrix}1&2\\ 3&4\end{pmatrix}; A+A; A-A; 2*A; A^5; A^t; A^-1; A \otimes A; A \oplus A; \det A](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%22A%3D%5C%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D1%262%5C%5C%5C%5C%203%264%5C%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D%3B%5CnA%2BA%3B%5CnA-A%3B%5Cn2*A%3B%5CnA%5E5%3B%5CnA%5Et%3B%5CnA%5E-1%3B%5CnA%20%5C%5Cotimes%20A%3B%5CnA%20%5C%5Coplus%20A%3B%5Cn%5C%5Cdet%20A%22%2C%22monitoring%22%3A%22true%22%7D)


Matrices work just as well with radicals.
```
A=\begin{pmatrix}sqrt(1)&sqrt(2)\\ sqrt(3)&sqrt(4)\end{pmatrix}; 
A+A; 
A-A; 
2*A; 
A^5; 
A^-1;
```
[A=\begin{pmatrix}sqrt(1)&sqrt(2)\\ sqrt(3)&sqrt(4)\end{pmatrix}; A+A; A-A; 2*A; A^5; A^-1;](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%22A%3D%5C%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7Dsqrt(1)%26sqrt(2)%5C%5C%5C%5C%20sqrt(3)%26sqrt(4)%5C%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D%3B%5CnA%2BA%3B%5CnA-A%3B%5Cn2*A%3B%5CnA%5E5%3B%5CnA%5E-1%3B%5Cn%5Cn%20%22%7D)


Matrices over the rational functions work as well.
```
a=MakeMatrix ((1-x, 2), (3, 4-x));
\det a;
SolveFor(x,MakeExpression( \det a));
```
[a=MakeMatrix ((1-x, 2), (3, 4-x));\det a;SolveFor(x,MakeExpression( \det a));](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%22a%3DMakeMatrix%20((1-x%2C%202)%2C%20(3%2C%204-x))%3B%5Cn%5C%5Cdet%20a%3B%5CnSolveFor(x%2CMakeExpression(%20%5C%5Cdet%20a))%3B%5Cn%22%2C%22monitoring%22%3A%22true%22%7D)


### Define your own function
Define a two-variable function and evaluate it. Evaluation/substitution need not be numerical. The syntax `{}` is used to denote function application - carefully chosen so it has no visible artifacts in LaTeX (recall that in math texts, function application vs multiplication is implied from context, not from the notation). 
```
f{}({{a}}, {{b}}) = 1/(a+b); 
f{}(2,3); 
f{}(x+3, 1/(x^2-1))
```
[f{}({{a}}, {{b}}) = 1/(a+b); f{}(2,3); f{}(x+3, 1/(x^2-1))](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%22f%7B%7D(%7B%7Ba%7D%7D%2C%20%7B%7Bb%7D%7D)%20%3D%201%2F(a%2Bb)%3B%20f%7B%7D(2%2C3)%3B%20f%7B%7D(x%2B3%2C%201%2F(x%5E2-1))%22%7D)

Make a matrix from a two-variable function.
```
f{}({{a}}, {{b}}) = 1/(a+b);
A= FunctionToMatrix(f,10,10);
\det A
```
[f{}({{a}}, {{b}}) = 1/(a+b);A= FunctionToMatrix(f,10,10);\det A](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%22f%7B%7D(%7B%7Ba%7D%7D%2C%20%7B%7Bb%7D%7D)%20%3D%201%2F(a%2Bb)%3B%5CnA%3D%20FunctionToMatrix(f%2C10%2C10)%3B%5Cn%5C%5Cdet%20A%22%7D)

The syntax `{{ a }}` in the example above means "any a". In math, that the `a` in `{{a}}` is called a bound variable. Thus, the syntax `f{}({{a}},{{b}});` would match `f{}(2,3)`, `f{}(x,y)`, etc. If we were to drop the `{{}}` curly braces, then `f{}(a,b)` would only match the letters `a` and `b`.

Recursive functions just work. Here's the Fibonacci sequence.
```
Fib{}0=1; 
Fib{}1=1; 
Fib{}{{n}} = Fib{}(n-1)+Fib{}(n-2);
Fib{}49; 
Fib{}50; 
g{}{{n}} = 1/sqrt(5) (((1+sqrt(5))/2)^n - ((1- sqrt(5))/2)^n); 
g{}50; 
g{}51;
```
[Fib{}0=1; Fib{}1=1; Fib{}{{n}} = Fib{}(n-1)+Fib{}(n-2);Fib{}49; Fib{}50; g{}{{n}} = 1/sqrt(5) (((1+sqrt(5))/2)^n - ((1- sqrt(5))/2)^n); g{}50; g{}51;](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%22Fib%7B%7D0%3D1%3B%20Fib%7B%7D1%3D1%3B%20Fib%7B%7D%7B%7Bn%7D%7D%20%3D%20Fib%7B%7D(n-1)%2BFib%7B%7D(n-2)%3BFib%7B%7D49%3B%20Fib%7B%7D50%3B%5Cng%7B%7D%7B%7Bn%7D%7D%20%3D%201%2F%20sqrt(5)%20(((1%2B%20sqrt(5))%20%2F2%20)%5En%20-%20((1-%20sqrt(5))%20%2F2%20)%5En)%3B%5Cng%7B%7D50%3B%5Cng%7B%7D51%3B%5Cn%22%7D)

Notice the engine does not discard previously computed values of the `Fib` function defined above, and is thus able to compute the expression efficiently.
```
Fib{}0=1; 
Fib{}1=1; 
Fib{}{{n}} = Fib{}(n-1)+Fib{}(n-2);
LogEvaluationSteps(Fib{}10)
```
[Fib{}0=1; Fib{}1=1; Fib{}{{n}} = Fib{}(n-1)+Fib{}(n-2);LogEvaluationSteps(Fib{}10)](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%22Fib%7B%7D0%3D1%3B%20Fib%7B%7D1%3D1%3B%20Fib%7B%7D%7B%7Bn%7D%7D%20%3D%20Fib%7B%7D(n-1)%2BFib%7B%7D(n-2)%3B%5Cn%5CnLogEvaluationSteps(Fib%7B%7D10)%22%7D)

### Differentiate and integrate
Differentiate basic functions.
```

```
[d/dx( e^{3x} \sin (2x) \ln x)](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%22d%2Fdx(%20e%5E%7B3x%7D%20%5C%5Csin%20(2x)%20%5C%5Cln%20x)%22%7D)

Integrate rational functions (the lack of +C in the integral is deliberate).
```
\int (x+3) / (x^2+x+1)^2 dx
```
[\int (x+3) / (x^2+x+1)^2 dx](https://calculator-algebra.org:8166/#%7B%22currentPage%22%3A%22calculator%22%2C%22calculatorInput%22%3A%22%5C%5Cint%20(x%2B3)%20%2F%20(x%5E2%2Bx%2B1)%5E2%20dx%22%7D)

Some trig integrals work too.
```

## How does it work?
All computations handled by the calculator are held in a universal and arbitrarily nested data structure:

`Expression`

The fundamental math `Expression` is very simple: it contains a data entry, a single signed 32-bit or 64-bit integer, and an arbitrary array (allowed to be empty) of other `Expression`s (sub-expressions). Expressions that contain no sub-expressions are called atoms / leafs.

Here's a plot of the math expression `a+b`.
```

```

Here is more complicated mathematical expression - an integral.
```

The calculator engine is a math substitution engine - i.e., an engine designed to make one of the most powerful mathematical techniques - the mathematical substitution - as straightforward as possible.

It keeps on applying a set of rules - mathematical transformations - to the starting expression, until no more rules can be applied. Thus, it easily models mathematical operations such as uncovering parenthesis and substitutions. 

Calculator programs - a sequence of mathematical expressions with earlier expressions affecting the interpretation of later expressions - are expressions by themselves.
