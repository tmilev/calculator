# OpenSSL

We are currently trying to eliminate the openSSL dependency of the calculator. 
To do so, we will attempt to pull all 
relevant openssl code into the calculator and remove all parts not related 
to our use case. 

We are using the source code of openSSL. OpenSSL is licensed under 
the Apache 2.0 license. 
We are including a copy of its license file in this folder.
